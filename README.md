# bikesharing
Create visualizations using Tableau to analyze New York bike sharing data.


## Overviw of the project 

For this analysis, we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, youâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.



This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. You will submit the following:

1- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
2- Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
3- Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
