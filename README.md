Create visualizations using Tableau to analyze New York bike sharing data.


## Overviw of the project 

For this analysis, we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, youâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.



This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present your results. You will submit the following:

1- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

2- Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

3- Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation


## Resources

- Data :
- Software : Python, Jupyter, Tableau Public.

## Summary

**New York Citi Bike data visualizations for August 2019**

- There were over 2.3 million rides for the month of August 2019.
- 81% of the users were subscribers. 65% of the users were confirmed males and 25% were confirmed females.
- There is a wide range of the age of the users. Younger users tend to use the service for longer rides.
- Top ride starting locations are in the most touristic and busy areas, as we see here in Manhattan.
